	with auto-wire tag we simply leave it to spring to inject dependencies for a bean...
	
	some notes to take care of here: 
	when we autowire some beans (collabotories) to some bean and we use the auto-wire machinery...
	,we are living the dependency injection to be done by spring container... 
	so when we invoke the bean or when the container reads the DD/xml file spring now scans every bean
	and the ones that have the autowire tags are then evaluated...
	by default spring has four modes of autowiring: 
	 1. NO (this is the default)
	 2. byName (this type of wiring is when spring...
	  looks at the beans declared name in the constructor/ property and looks for a bean in the xml/DD for a bean with that particular name
	  if found it injects it the bean when not found it sets it to null... note no exception is thrown with autowiring by name when the required bean is not found
	  might be prone to NPE)
	  3. byType
	  4. constructor
	  
	   
	  we can also do some cool stuff by setting restrictions on particular bean to not be eligeble for autowiring... with the autowire-candidate="false"
	  this means now this bean should not be "ref" or reference via the autowiring mechanism that spring container provides
	  byType and constructor modes are better in that they throw exceptions when they don't find the bean in question,
	  so the particular bean won't be initialised and as a result the application will not reach it's fully initialised state
	  another draw back is that autowiring is not explicit in the xml file, you can't get the full picture of a particular...
	  that has an autowire tag in it... for large application, that need clarity and the very professional systems where a lot of people are 
	  working on it can be a problem! so use these with cautions: "the right tool for the right job!"
