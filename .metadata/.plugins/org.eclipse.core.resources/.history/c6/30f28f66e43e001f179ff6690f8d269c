  <!--
	some notes to take care of here: 
	when we autowire some beans (collabotories) to some bean and we use the auto-wire machinery...
	,we are living the dependency injection to be done by spring container... 
	so when we invoke the bean or when the container reads the DD/xml file spring now scans every bean
	and the ones that have the autowire tags are then evaluated...
	by default spring has four modes of autowiring: 
	 1. NO (this is the default)
	 2. byName (this type of wiring is when spring...
	  looks at the beans declared name in the constructor/ property and looks for a bean in the xml/DD for a bean with that particular name
	   if found it injects it the bean when not found it sets it to null... note no exception is thrown with autowiring by name
	   might be prone to NPE)
